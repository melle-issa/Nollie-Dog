This is a website I made for a band named Nollie Dog that my friends started. I used this as an opportunity to practice using html and so I could show off what I'm able to do with the language so far. Last updated on 3/13/21. This website will continue to be updated as I am still working on it and the domain name has not yet been purchased.
